# PKI Extension

[Name TBD]  

## Description

Helps to keep users information secure by monitoring the certificate information websites that the users enter sensitive infomation into.

## How it will work

When users visit a website where they are entering sensitive information, like a banking website, they can mark the site as sensitive. The next time that they visit the website, must click on the extension to make sure that they are on the correct website and that their connection is secure (??). The user will not be able to access the site until they do this. [add more, eventually will be comprehensive instructions]

## Current Progress

- Save the domain and the CA as trusted/untrusted
- Check if the CA has changed since the last visit
- Notify the user if there are any changes

## Next Steps

- Understand why the CA is not consistent for certain websites
- Update the visuals of the extension

## Additional Features

[to be added, list of features that we will work on once basic extension is finished]

## Additional Notes (taken from 'Information' file)

- personalize the Extension
- split the flowchart to be new website vs visited website
- ask the user if it is a sensitive website or use if it's an auto fill to work that out
