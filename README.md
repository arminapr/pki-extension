# PKI Extension

[Name TBD]  

## Description

Helps to keep users information secure by monitoring the certificate information websites that the users enter sensitive infomation into.

## How it will work

When users visit a website where they are entering sensitive information, like a banking website, they can mark the site as sensitive. The next time that they visit the website, must click on the extension to make sure that they are on the correct website and that their connection is secure (??). The user will not be able to access the site until they do this. [add more, eventually will be comprehensive instructions]

## Current Progress

- Created a flowchart to map how the extension works
- Began to look at how browser extensions are made
- Began work on a simple browser extension

## Next Steps

- Make sure flowchart is correct and continue fine-tune details
- Continue to learn about development of browser extensions
- Add features to basic extension that will used in our final product

## Additional Features

[to be added, list of features that we will work on once basic extension is finished]

## Additional Notes (taken from 'Information' file)

- personalize the Extension
- split the flowchart to be new website vs visited website
- ask the user if it is a sensitive website or use if it's an auto fill to work that out
